# Proposal: Add Initial Home Screen

This proposal introduces the initial home screen for the Pocket Tasks application. The home screen will be the primary user interface, providing a dashboard overview for two children.

The screen will be divided into two equal halves, with each half dedicated to a child's dashboard. While the detailed view for each child is out of scope for this proposal, the UI elements will be designed to be clickable, allowing for future navigation.
